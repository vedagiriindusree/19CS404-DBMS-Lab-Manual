# Experiment 10: PL/SQL â€“ Triggers
### Name :Vedagiri Indu Sree
### Reg No : 212223230236
## AIM
To write and execute PL/SQL trigger programs for automating actions in response to specific table events like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

---

## THEORY

A trigger is a stored PL/SQL block that is automatically executed or fired when a specified event occurs on a table or view. Triggers can be used for enforcing business rules, auditing changes, or automatic updates.

### Types of Triggers:
- Before Trigger: Executes before the operation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- After Trigger: Executes after the operation.
- Row-level Trigger: Executes for each affected row.
- Statement-level Trigger: Executes once for the triggering statement.

Basic Syntax:
```
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trigger_name
BEFORE|AFTER INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE ON table_name
[FOR EACH ROW]
BEGIN
   -- trigger logic
END;
```

## 1. Write a trigger to log every insertion into a table.
Steps:
- Create two tables: employees (for storing data) and employee_log (for logging the inserts).
- Write an AFTER INSERT trigger on the employees table to log the new data into the employee_log table.

Expected Output:
- A new entry is added to the employee_log table each time a new record is inserted into the employees table.
```
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id     NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name   VARCHAR2(100),
    emp_dept   VARCHAR2(50),
    emp_salary NUMBER
);
CREATE TABLE employee_log (
    log_id       NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_id       NUMBER,
    emp_name     VARCHAR2(100),
    emp_dept     VARCHAR2(50),
    emp_salary   NUMBER,
    inserted_at  DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE
);
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_log_employee_insert
AFTER INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO employee_log (emp_id, emp_name, emp_dept, emp_salary)
    VALUES (:NEW.emp_id, :NEW.emp_name, :NEW.emp_dept, :NEW.emp_salary);
END;
/
INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, emp_name, emp_dept, emp_salary)
VALUES (101, 'Alice', 'HR', 50000);

SELECT * FROM employee_log;

```

## 2. Write a trigger to prevent deletion of records from a sensitive table.
Steps:
- Write a BEFORE DELETE trigger on the sensitive_data table.
- Use RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR to prevent deletion and issue a custom error message.

Expected Output:
- If an attempt is made to delete a record from sensitive_data, an error message is raised, e.g., ERROR: Deletion not allowed on this table.
```
CREATE TABLE sensitive_data (
    data_id    NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    data_value VARCHAR2(100)
);

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_prevent_delete_sensitive
BEFORE DELETE ON sensitive_data
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'ERROR: Deletion not allowed on this table.');
END;
/

INSERT INTO sensitive_data (data_id, data_value) VALUES (1, 'Confidential Info');


DELETE FROM sensitive_data WHERE data_id = 1;

```
## 3. Write a trigger to automatically update a last_modified timestamp.
Steps:
- Add a last_modified column to the products table.
- Write a BEFORE UPDATE trigger on the products table to set the last_modified column to the current timestamp whenever an update occurs.

Expected Output:
- The last_modified column in the products table is updated automatically to the current date and time when any record is updated.

```
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id     NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name   VARCHAR2(100),
    price          NUMBER(10, 2),
    quantity       NUMBER
);

INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name, price, quantity)
VALUES (101, 'Laptop', 850.00, 10);

INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name, price, quantity)
VALUES (102, 'Mouse', 25.50, 100);


CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_update_last_modified
BEFORE UPDATE ON products
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    :NEW.last_modified := SYSDATE;
END;
/
-- Update a product
UPDATE products
SET product_name = 'New Name'
WHERE product_id = 101;

-- Check the last_modified column
SELECT product_id, product_name, last_modified
FROM products
WHERE product_id = 101;
```

## 4. Write a trigger to keep track of the number of updates made to a table.
Steps:
- Create an audit_log table with a counter column.
- Write an AFTER UPDATE trigger on the customer_orders table to increment the counter in the audit_log table every time a record is updated.

Expected Output:
- The audit_log table will maintain a count of how many updates have been made to the customer_orders table.
```
CREATE TABLE customer_orders (
    order_id     NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id  NUMBER,
    order_date   DATE,
    total_amount NUMBER
);
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
    table_name     VARCHAR2(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    update_count   NUMBER DEFAULT 0
);
INSERT INTO audit_log (table_name, update_count)
VALUES ('CUSTOMER_ORDERS', 0);
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_count_updates_customer_orders
AFTER UPDATE ON customer_orders
BEGIN
    UPDATE audit_log
    SET update_count = update_count + 1
    WHERE table_name = 'CUSTOMER_ORDERS';
END;
/
-- Update a row in customer_orders
UPDATE customer_orders
SET total_amount = total_amount + 10
WHERE order_id = 1;

-- Check the update count
SELECT * FROM audit_log;
```

## 5. Write a trigger that checks a condition before allowing insertion into a table.
Steps:
- Write a BEFORE INSERT trigger on the employees table to check if the inserted salary meets a specific condition (e.g., salary must be greater than 3000).
- If the condition is not met, raise an error to prevent the insert.

Expected Output:
- If the inserted salary in the employees table is below the condition (e.g., salary < 3000), the insert operation is blocked, and an error message is raised, such as: ERROR: Salary below minimum threshold.
```
CREATE TABLE employee (
    emp_id     NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name   VARCHAR2(100),
    salary     NUMBER
);
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_check_min_salary
BEFORE INSERT ON employee
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF :NEW.salary < 3000 THEN
        RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20002, 'ERROR: Salary below minimum threshold.');
    END IF;
END;
/
INSERT INTO employee (emp_id, emp_name, salary)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 2500);

INSERT INTO employee (emp_id, emp_name, salary)
VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith', 4000);
```
