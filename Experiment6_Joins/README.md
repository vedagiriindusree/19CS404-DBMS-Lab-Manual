# Experiment 6: Joins
## Name:Vedagiri Indu Sree
## Reg.no:212223230236
## AIM
To study and implement different types of joins.

## THEORY

SQL Joins are used to combine records from two or more tables based on a related column.

### 1. INNER JOIN
Returns records with matching values in both tables.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### 2. LEFT JOIN
Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```
### 3. RIGHT JOIN
Returns all records from the right table, and matched records from the left.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```
### 4. FULL OUTER JOIN
Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

**Question 1**
Write the SQL query that achieves the selection of the "cust_name" column from the "customer" table (aliased as "c") and the "name" column from the "salesman" table (aliased as "s"), with a left join on the "salesman_id" column and a condition filtering for customers in the same city as the salesman.
```
SELECT 
    c.cust_name AS "cust_name",
    s.name AS "name"
FROM 
    customer c
LEFT JOIN 
    salesman s ON c.salesman_id = s.salesman_id
WHERE 
    c.city = s.city;
```
**Output:**

**Question 2**
From the following tables write a SQL query to find those orders where the order amount exists between 500 and 2000. Return ord_no, purch_amt, cust_name, city.

Sample table: customer

```
SELECT 
    o.ord_no,
    o.purch_amt,
    c.cust_name,
    c.city
FROM 
    orders o
JOIN 
    customer c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
